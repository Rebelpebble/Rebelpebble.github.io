    <p>Can you believe that Pepe died?</p>
    <p>Pepe was a true friend and mascot to 4Chan.</p>
    <p>Here are three reasons that Pepe means a lot to me:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>He was a freind to all of us.</li>
      <li>So many funny memes of him are floating around.</li>
      <li>He would never let you down.</li>
    </ol>
